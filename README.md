# 🧠 ON-Cure: Brain Tumor Detection from MRI using Deep Learning

This web application uses a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect brain tumors from MRI scans. Built using **Flask**, this tool assists in identifying tumor types with high confidence and provides relevant hospital contacts and medical information.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Upload MRI images and detect brain tumors (Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, or No Tumor).
- Displays prediction result with confidence score and image preview.
- Informative pages about symptoms, protection, and hospital contacts.
- Developer profile page.
- Simple and clean user interface.
